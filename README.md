# README

## Overview

Welcome to the **Mathematics for Data Science** repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing my learning journey in data science, focusing on the mathematical foundations. Here, you will find a collection of hand written notes that I have compiled from day one of my learning process up to the present day.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a structured resource for anyone interested in learning data science through a strong mathematical background. These hand written notes are intended to be a helpful guide for those who wish to follow a similar learning path or simply want to enhance their understanding of the mathematical concepts behind data science.

## Contents

- **hand written notes in PDF Format**: This repository contains a series of PDF documents that encapsulate my learning hand written notes. Each document covers various mathematical topics and concepts related to data science.

## Learning Journey

I am currently learning data science in my free time, and I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. By documenting my hand written notes and sharing them on this platform, I hope to foster a collaborative learning environment. I encourage others to read, learn, and even contribute to this repository if they wish!

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore the hand written notes**: Browse through the PDF files to find topics that interest you or that you would like to learn more about.
2. **Follow the Learning Path**: You can follow the same pattern I used in my learning journey, adapting it to fit your own pace and interests.
3. **Engage with the Community**: Feel free to reach out with questions, feedback, or suggestions. Collaboration is key in the learning process!
